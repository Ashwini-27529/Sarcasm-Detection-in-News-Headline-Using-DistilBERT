# Sarcasm-Detection-in-News-Headline-Using-DistilBERT
MCA Final year Research paper based project - Sarcasm Detection in news headline using DistilBERT a lightweight transformer based approach

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This research addresses the challenge of identifying sarcasm in brief, context-sparse news headlines[cite: 1, 151]. [cite_start]While social media platforms offer cues like hashtags and emojis, news headlines rely purely on subtle linguistic incongruity[cite: 12, 169, 1301]. [cite_start]This project employs **DistilBERT**, a lightweight transformer model, to achieve a balance between high detection accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment[cite: 46, 105, 1226].

## Key Features
* [cite_start]**Architectural Efficiency:** Uses DistilBERT, which is 40% smaller and 60% faster than BERT-base while retaining 95-97% of its performance[cite: 93, 100, 103, 864].
* [cite_start]**Precision-Oriented:** The model follows a conservative classification strategy, prioritizing high precision (reliability) to minimize false positives in media monitoring[cite: 121, 928, 1132].
* [cite_start]**Interpretability:** Employs visual analytics such as confusion matrices and ROC curves to demystify model behavior[cite: 120, 216, 704].

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection** from Kaggle.

* **Author:** Rishabh Misra
* **Description:** This dataset contains high-quality headlines from *The Onion* and *HuffPost* for the task of sarcasm detection.
